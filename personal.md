Outside my research, I do a variety of things to balance out my life. 
Here are a couple of my interests that I always enjoy discussing:

# Physical Health 
I like to eat pretty healthy and exercise regularly. These days, 
I mainly lift weights and hike - there are so many awesome trails in the area! 
In the past I have also been into running.

# Social Justice
Once you start to see the ways in which the world treats 
people unequally for no good reason, there is no going back. Thinking 
about how mistreatment due to gender, race, and class strongly impacts how 
I see the world. Relatedly, I have and continue to engage in a number of 
activities to attempt to remedy these situations. For instance, I seek to 
promote diversity in the physics department through The Berkeley 
Compass Project and create an environment free of sexual harassment 
through The Respect is a Part of Research group. 

# Education
Ever since I enjoyed learning, I have been excited about the 
opportunity to share my experience. I have done a variety of forms of 
mentoring and teaching. I've also enjoyed learning about various 
techniques of being a more effective teacher (and communicator in general).
