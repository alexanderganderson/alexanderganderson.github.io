# Exercise
Some of my favorite spots are: the Berkeley fire trails (for a beautiful hike or
a *challenging* trail run), the Berkeley RSF (for weight lifting and
calisthenics), Yoga to the People (for Vinyasa Yoga), and the Berkeley YWCA
(for dance classes)!

# Politics
While politics has become very divisive lately, it is
fundamentally about working together to making our lives better.
I find it valuable to keep up to date about what is going on in the world.
Some of the campaigns that I am most excited about right now are Campaign Zero
(policies for ending Police Violence in America)
and Justice Democrats (democrats running for office who refuse to take
corporate money).

The unfortunate reality is that many people's lives are difficult for no good
reason.  Once you start to this, there is no going back. Thinking about how
mistreatment due to gender, race, and class strongly impacts how I see the
world. See my volunteering page for what I'm doing about it!

# Education
Ever since I started learning, I have been excited about the opportunity to
share my positive experiences. I enjoy mentoring, teaching, and learning how to
be a better communicator.
