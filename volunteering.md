In my time as a graduate student, I have had the awesome opportunity to
contribute to an number of initiatives on campus. Indeed, I see my
contributions to these efforts as a essential part what I do (although the
incentive structure for a science career doesn't reward these efforts much).
Key takeaways:

- Early opportunities to participate and organize prepared me to take on more
  responsibility down the line (e.g. developing more complex programs).
- The majority of the battle is just showing up. Even though I don't feel
  particularly qualified to do much of what I've done, there was nobody else to
  do it, so I stepped up.  I hope that others can see how much they can
  accomplish by just showing up.
- While showing up is the first step, it is also crucial to spend time
  learning how we have come to the beliefs that we have and what we can do to
  change the negative ones (e.g. through seeking out the relevent knowledge
  from sociology, feminism, education theory, etc). This can be hard
  emotionally, but is crucial for developing being as effective as possible.
- Designing programs to help others has helped me tremendously.

# [The Berkeley Math Tournament][bmt] (2013-Present):

**Roles**: Problem Writer, Graduate Student Advisor for the Berkeley Math Tournament

**Summary**: As a high school student, I loved doing math contest problems.
Solving problems that required creativity as opposed to memorization was
critical to my intellectual development. As a Berkeley student, I contribute
some of my time to organize these opportunities to learn for future
generations. First, I have written challenging and exciting problems for the
tournament. Second, I serve as an advisor to help make organization wide
decisions. A summary of my involvement in the organization (BMT is the high
school version and BmMT is the middle school version of the tournament):

- BMT - Spring 2013 - Problem Writer, Power Round Writer
- BmMT - Fall 2013 - Problem Writer
- BMT - Spring 2014 - Problem Writer, Graduate Student Advisor
- BmMT - Fall 2014 - Problem Writer, Graduate Student Advisor
- BMT - Spring 2015 - Problem Writer (Geometry), Graduate Student Advisor
- BmMT - Fall 2015 - Day of Runner, Advisor
- BMT - Spring 2016 - Day of Runner, Advisor
- BmMT - Fall 2016 - Day of Runner, Advisor


# [ Respect is a Part of Research][rpr] (2015 - Present):

**Roles**: Facilitator and Mentor Training Coordinator

**Summary**: It is an inconvenient truth that sexual harassment has been and
continues to be relatively common in the the physics department (and many other
academic departments). The goal of this group is to reduce sexual harassment in
the department by running a workshop on appropriate graduate student conduct.

- In fall 2015, I was a facilitator during the workshop. This involved learning
  how to facilitate discussions about problematic situations. Further, we
  learned about the university procedures and how to respond when somebody
  comes to us with an issue.
- In spring 2016, I took on the role of organizing the training for the
  workshop. This involved collecting materials from previous years, and
  refining them (e.g. improving the support for how to conduct the workshop,
  and how a facilitator can be a useful resource for the community after the
  workshop is over).
- In fall 2016, we applied for, and recieved a grant in order to use a social
  norms change intervention in our department. While we are still working out
  the details of the campaign, the main idea is to offer a positive vision of
  what we want our department to be like (e.g. great physicists use their
  ability to question underlying assumptions of the physical world to question
  underlying assumptions about our social world).


# [The Berkeley Compass Project][compass] (2012 - 2014):

**Roles**: Teacher, Summer Program Assistant, and Mentoring Program Organizer

**Summary**: Compass is a undergraduate and graduate student association
dedicated to promoting a diverse and inclusive community in the physical
sciences.  Since its inception in 2006, Compass has done this though a variety
of efforts including mentorship programs, experimental physics classes, and a
summer program. As a graduate student, I have had the awesome opportunity to
work with the Berkeley Compass Project. This organization played an important
role in helping me develop my ability to plan and execute on community
improvement projects. Furthermore, in helping with these efforts, I learned a
lot of useful things for myself (e.g. becoming more resilient to impostor
syndrome, valuing work-life balance). I contributed to a variety of programs:

- I was a residential assistant for the 2013 Compass Summer Program where a
  diverse cohort of 20 incoming freshmen form friendships and learn about a fun
  scientific topic (our year was: how do we determine where sound is coming
  from?).
- I co-taught the 2012 Fall Compass Course on Building Scientific Models with
  John Haberstroh. In this class there are no lectures and students drive the
  development of the course. Three major focuses of the course were: effective
  communication and group work skills, consistent and critical self-reflection,
  and practicing working on real scientific problems.
- I directed the 2013-2014 Compass Mentoring program. In addition to pairing
  the 20 incoming students with graduate student mentors, I organized six
  mentoring workshops throughout the year with the help of some awesome
  Berkeley grad students. I also mentored a few students myself!
- In Fall 2015, I was a project mentor for the Compass Transfer Course. I
  helped undergraduate students do a literature review related to computational
  neuroscience. I've been working with one of those students for about a year
  now on research as well!
