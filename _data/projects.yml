#   title: The High Dimensional Geometry of Binary Neural Networks
#   authors: Alexander G. Anderson, Cory P. Berg
#   location: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) Workshop Track
#   date: April 24th-26th, 2017
#   desc: Due to the high dimensional geometry of binary vectors, continuous feature vectors can be well-approximated by binary vectors.
#       This gives a theoretical foundation for the success of the Courbariaux, Hubara, et al. method of training neural networks with binary weights and activations.
#       The theory is also validated in such networks.
