  title: The High Dimensional Geometry of Binary Neural Networks
  authors: Alexander G.  Anderson, Cory P. Berg
  location: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)
  date: April 24th-26th 2017
  desc: Due to the high dimensional geometry of binary vectors, continuous feature vectors can be well-approximated by binary vectors.
      This gives a theoretical foundation for the success of the Courbariaux, Hubara, et al. method of training neural networks with binary weights and activations.
      The theory is also validated in such networks.
