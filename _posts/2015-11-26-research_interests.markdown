<h2>
  Current Research Interests
</h2>

After establishing myself in the Redwood center for theoretical neuroscience, 
I have come to enjoy a number of general research areas and techniques. Here 
is a outline of the concepts that currently inform my research:

<h3> Statistics and Machine Learning: </h3>
Bayesian Models, Graphical Modeling, Hidden Markov Models, GLM Modeling, Sampling Algorithms (eg. Particle Filtering, MCMC, HMC, Gibbs Sampling), Information theory, Rate-Distortion Theory, Maximum Entropy Models, Optimization Methods (eg. Improving on Gradient Descent)

<h3> Deep Learning </h3>
Back Propagation (including Automatic Differentiation), Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks, LSTMs, Energy Models (including contrastive divergence, Minimum Probability Flow, Ising Models, RBMs), Neural Network Art, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Diffusion Probabilistic Models 

<h3> Vision </h3>
Retina, LGN, Visual Cortex, Fixational Eye Movements, Scanning Laser Opthalmoscopy(SP??), Models of Feedback

<h3> Computational Neuroscience </h3>
Redundancy Reduction, Efficient Coding, Sparse Coding (and variants, such as Locally Competitive Algorithm, SAILnet), Natural Scene Statistics, GLM Models of Early Visual Processing, Hierarchical Models, Models of Feedback, Hopfield Networks

<h3> Computer Vision </h3>
Image Pyramids, Fourier Methods for Images, Optical Flow, Image Segmentation

<h3> Programming </h3>
Object Oriented Programming, Python, C++, emacs, vim, Sublime Text 3, theano, blocks, caffe, git

<h3> Past Interests </h3>
High School Math Competitions (focus on Euclidean Geometry and Algebra), Abstract Algebra, Complex Analysis, Behavior of Dynamical Systems, Perturbation Theory, Asymptotics, Non-Diffusive Random Walks
