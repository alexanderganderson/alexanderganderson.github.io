One of the most important things that you can do to have an impactful career is
to *develop* a clear vision of your long term goals.
This is difficult in machine learning
because your work needs to strike a balance between being achievable and novel.
Furthermore, it needs to be motivating to you personally, and impactful to others.

# Choosing who to work with

One of the most important steps in your career is evaluating the visions of
different potential mentors/managers and ultimately deciding who to work with.  First,
you want to look for people who work on problems that you find to be motivating
and important. Second, there needs to be room for growth within that field.  In
order to build your ability to choose better collaborators over time, it is
beneficial to understand how your mentors built their career over time.  What
motivated them to do each of their past projects?  How did they scope out
intermediate milestones to pursue their larger goals?  What problems do they
consider to be *not* worthwhile (sometimes what you choose not to work on is as
important as what you choose to work on)?  While you can't just copy
the career trajectory of your mentor, you'll be better positioned to carve out
your own path if you understand why they did what they did.

# Maintaining a consistent direction with increasing impact over time

Since people are looking for the best person to solve a particular job or
investigate a certain area, it pays to be excellent in one area rather than to
be good in a number of areas.  You should aim to be an expert in a particular
ML subfield (e.g.  language translation, robotics) or a ML technology that
solves a specific business problem (e.g.  recommendation algorithms).
Furthermore, a successful career is composed of a series of milestones that
move towards a specific direction with increasing scope over time.  In reality,
to get your foot in the door, you may need to do projects with goals that
aren't particularly motivating to you.  Regardless, you will get the
opportunity to demonstrate competency and an ability to grow. If you complete
smaller projects well, people will be willing to entrust you with larger, more
important projects in the future.  Additionally, you should aim to  do projects
in the same area with increasing scope and impact.  However, in reality, not
every project you do will be along one career trajectory. In this case, you can
still make progress by reflecting on what you found most motivating in the past
and try to make better decisions in the future in terms of what to work on.


# Achievable yet novel

A central challenge of developing a career trajectory is to do work that is
both achievable and novel. One key is to identify an area where the research
ideas and technology have only recently gotten powerful enough to make
meaningful progress.
For instance, the breakthrough in image classification
came when innovations in neural network optimization came
together
with sufficient computational power (e.g. train a ~10 layer neural network with ~100
channels per layer on a million images for a number of epochs).
In order to explore this idea further, I'll consider two researchers (now
assistant professors at top universities) who started their Ph.D's around the
time that I did. For reference, a watershed moment in deep learning was late
2012 when Krizhevsky et al. developed the first convolutional neural
network approach to outperform classical methods on image compression.

[Chelsea Finn] at Stanford has become an expert in developing intelligent
robots. Back in 2014, there were exciting successes in classification, but
robotics had seen relatively few applications of deep
learning. Robotics is difficult because you need an actual robot
and the advances in neural networks (algorithms and accelerators) were
relatively new.  Thus the research area was prime for growth due to the
convergence of different ideas and technology.
Her work has
investigated algorithms that can enable an embodied agent to learn its
sensor-motor relationships through exploration. Furthermore, there is the
promise of more robust industrial robots.

[Song Han] at MIT has become an expert in the topic of efficient deployment of
neural networks.  Back in 2014, again, neural networks were achieving
impressive research results, but there were many unanswered questions on the
topic of practical deployment. Song and collaborators were able to identify
that the size of the parameter files was a large problem and doubled down on
developing network compression methods. Their work made it much easier,
for instance, to add a neural network to an app that needs to be downloaded
onto many devices with limited disk space.  Since then, he has been effective
in working with industry partners to identify other deployment challenges
related to speed and different hardware.


# Final Thoughts

All that being said, identifying an area with the potential for a lot of growth
is only one step of the process.  These researchers were successful because
they were additionally able to scope out specific milestones within their
domain and find actual solutions to those intermediate goals.
