**Career Booster Plan (Weekly Activities + 12 Sessions)**
- A free initial discussion to brainstorm goals and areas of improvement
- Develop a weekly action plan to achieve a career goal that is meaningful to
  you
- Personalized feedback on your progress via 12 one hour coaching sessions


**Methodology**:

<!-- I'll send you my proprietary assessment to identify potential areas to work on. -->
Career success is the product of *quality work* put towards a *valuable goal*.
My philosophy for career success involves three key components:

- Do better work in fewer hours by improving your ability to prioritize
- Multiply your impact by getting the most out of your interactions with your coworkers
- Improve your work quality by managing your time, health and emotional well-being

Aims of the initial consultation and the first few sessions:
- Identify a concrete goal to target and work together to develop a 12 week
  action plan. Example goals:
    - Do innovative work that will get you more respect and influence at work
    - Reduce work-related stress and attain a better work-life balance
    - Learn strategies to better manage difficult interactions with coworkers
- Determine if there is a fit between my background and your career ambitions


Since a consistent commitment is necessary to achieve the best results, expect to meet weekly for
at least 12 weeks once a clear action plan has been created.

**About Me**

When you look for a mentor, you want to look for three things. First,
somebody who has accomplished things that you want to accomplish. Second,
a person who can break down their process and give you personalized advice.
Third, an individual that has a similar self-improvement style.

If you think we would be a good match, please reach out!
