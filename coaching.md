I offer two ways to engage in coaching:

1. Project Plan Review / Practice Qualifying Exam
2. Extended One-on-One Coaching

# Project Plan Review / Practice Qualifying Exam

In this coaching offering, you will prepare a written project plan or an oral
presentation, and I will give you detailed and actionable feedback in one or
more paid sessions.

Strategically chosen projects are critical to the advancement of your career
and a project plan will help you get results in a timely manner.
One one hand, writing a plan will help you clarify your thinking and identify promising directions.
On the other hand, a detailed plan empowers peers and mentors to give you personalized advice.

In an initial consultation, we will discuss what you should prepare so that I
can give you the best possible advice. In a subsequent session, I will
review your work and provide detailed feedback. These review
sessions can be repeated in order to fine-tune your proposal. To get a general
idea of what this might look like, consider the following questions for
industry and academic proposals.

In the case of an *industry* proposal, your plan may discuss the
following:
- The current status of your project area and the current problems.
- Why your project is most important thing that you can be doing within the scope of your job.
- The revenue impact to the business / the reduction of internal costs.
- The different design/architectural decisions and why is your approach the best one.
- How this project will help you build your case for promotion.
- The potential risks of the project failing and how can you mitigate them.

In the case of an *academic research* proposal, the plan may discuss the following:
- The potential for the project to advance understanding within its
  field and the benefits to society.
- A summary of the existing work on the subject and its limitations.
- A well-reasoned research plan, outlining different alternatives, and why your
  approach is the best one.
- Your current progress.
- The likelihood that other researchers will build upon your work
  assuming that it is successful.
- The way in which this this project fits within a long-term academic career trajectory.

# One-on-One Coaching
- A free initial discussion to brainstorm goals and areas of improvement
- Develop a weekly action plan to achieve a career goal that is meaningful to
  you
- Personalized feedback on your progress via 12 one hour coaching sessions


**Methodology**:

<!-- I'll send you my proprietary assessment to identify potential areas to work on. -->
Career success is the product of *quality work* put towards a *valuable goal*.
My philosophy for career success involves three key components:

- Do better work in fewer hours by improving your ability to prioritize
- Multiply your impact by getting the most out of your interactions with your coworkers
- Improve your work quality by managing your time, health and emotional well-being

Aims of the initial consultation and the first few sessions:
- Identify a concrete goal to target and work together to develop a 12 week
  action plan. Example goals:
    - Do innovative work that will get you more respect and influence at work
    - Reduce work-related stress and attain a better work-life balance
    - Learn strategies to better manage difficult interactions with coworkers
- Determine if there is a fit between my background and your career ambitions


Since a consistent commitment is necessary to achieve the best results, expect to meet weekly for
at least 12 weeks once a clear action plan has been created.



# About Me

When you look for a mentor, you want to look for three things. First,
somebody who has accomplished things that you want to accomplish. Second,
a person who can break down their process and give you personalized advice.
Third, an individual that has a similar self-improvement style.

If you think we would be a good match, please reach out!

**Endorsements**

To get a sense of what I'll be like as a coach, consider these endorsements
from my collaborators during my Ph.D.:

"*Alex was my research mentor at UC Berkeley while I was an undergrad. He took
me on for a few projects despite my major being unrelated to machine learning,
and he worked really hard to teach me not only the subject matter and research
best-practices, but a variety of general skills that I still apply day-to-day
professionally. He was a great teacher who pushed me to do better every chance
he got and he genuinely cared about my success.*"

-- Cory Berg  (paper published at ICLR)


"*Alex and I shared an office for over 2 years, during which time we worked on a
number of projects and published a paper.
Alex developed a clear strategy for the projects we worked on, outlining each
sub-task with accompanying milestones.
He provided helpful, constructive feedback any many projects in the broader
group we were a part of.
Many members of our broader group would seek advice from him on their projects
or career trajectories.*"

-- Ryan Zarcone, Ph.D.
