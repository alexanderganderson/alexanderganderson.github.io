# **Weekly Office Hours**

Grab dinner and chat!
Unstructured time to discuss whatever you want in terms of your career growth
and general self-improvement. Mondays from 6-7 pm PST. Email
me for the zoom link. Let me know in advance if you plan to come!

# **Practice Interview Loop**

If you've ever been repeatedly been rejected after interviewing, you know how frustrating it is to not only
get those rejections but to not know *why* you were rejected in the first place.
The fact of the matter is that companies have no
incentive to be honest with you about where you stand. Alternatively, do you feel
unprepared for the high-stakes interviews that you are about to do and want to come into your
interviews with confidence?

Thats where I come in.

As an experienced engineer and mentor who is 100% on your side, I will give you honest, actionable feedback about your
interview skills so that you can come into the interview process with clarity and confidence.

I will interview you for a hypothetical job at a top tech company in deep learning research,
machine learning engineering or software engineering.
I have successfully interviewed at large companies like Facebook and Google and a number of
startups in the bay area.
I regularly conduct similar interviews for these roles at my current company where we have the same
high standards. A typical interview loop will include some of the following components (depending your target role
and what you want to practice):
- Coding interview (algorithms and data structures)
- Machine Learning Interview (math and machine learning fundamentals)
- Past Work Presentation / Resume Review (describe previous research or projects with questions)
- Culture Fit Interview (discussion to understand your work style, values, motivation, and so on)

Unlike a normal interview, I'll give you detailed feedback on what you did well and what you can
do to improve. Additionally, I will give you a sense of where you stand relative to other applicants at your level.

# **Project Plan Review / Practice Qualifying Exam**

You will prepare a written project plan or an oral
presentation, and I will give you detailed and actionable feedback in one or
more paid sessions.

Strategically chosen projects are critical to the advancement of your career
and a project plan will help you deliver high-impact results in a timely manner.
One one hand, writing a plan will help you clarify your thinking and identify promising directions.
On the other hand, a detailed plan empowers peers and mentors to give you personalized advice.

In an initial consultation, we will discuss what you should prepare so that I
can give you the best possible advice. In a subsequent session, I will
review your work and provide detailed feedback. These review
sessions can be repeated in order to fine-tune your proposal. To get a general
idea of what this might look like, consider the following questions for
industry and academic proposals.

In the case of an *industry* proposal, your plan may discuss the
following:
- The current status of your project area and the current problems.
- Why your project is most important thing that you can be doing within the scope of your job.
- The revenue impact to the business / the reduction of internal costs.
- The different design/architectural decisions and why is your approach the best one.
- How this project will help you build your case for promotion.
- The potential risks of the project failing and how can you mitigate them.

In the case of an *academic research* proposal, the plan may discuss the following:
- The potential for the project to advance understanding within its
  field and the benefits to society.
- A summary of the existing work on the subject and its limitations.
- A well-reasoned research plan, outlining different alternatives, and why your
  approach is the best one.
- Your current progress.
- The likelihood that other researchers will build upon your work
  assuming that it is successful.
- The way in which this this project fits within a long-term academic career trajectory.

# **One-on-One Coaching**
- A free initial discussion to brainstorm goals and areas of improvement
- Develop a weekly action plan to achieve a career goal that is meaningful to
  you
- Personalized feedback on your progress via 12 one hour coaching sessions


**Methodology**:

<!-- I'll send you my proprietary assessment to identify potential areas to work on. -->
Career success is the product of *quality work* put towards a *valuable goal*.
My philosophy for career success involves three key components:

- Do better work in fewer hours by improving your ability to prioritize
- Multiply your impact by getting the most out of your interactions with your coworkers
- Improve your work quality by managing your time, health and emotional well-being

Aims of the initial consultation and the first few sessions:
- Identify a concrete goal to target and work together to develop a 12 week
  action plan. Example goals:
    - Do innovative work that will get you more respect and influence at work
    - Reduce work-related stress and attain a better work-life balance
    - Learn strategies to better manage difficult interactions with coworkers
- Determine if there is a fit between my background and your career ambitions


Since a consistent commitment is necessary to achieve the best results, expect to meet weekly for
at least 12 weeks once a clear action plan has been created.



# **About Me**

When you look for a mentor, you want to look for three things. First,
somebody who has accomplished things that you want to accomplish. Second,
a person who can break down their process and give you personalized advice.
Third, an individual that has a similar self-improvement style.

**Endorsements**

To get a sense of what I'll be like as a coach, consider these endorsements
from my collaborators during my Ph.D.:

"*Alex was my research mentor at UC Berkeley while I was an undergrad. He took
me on for a few projects despite my major being unrelated to machine learning,
and he worked really hard to teach me not only the subject matter and research
best-practices, but a variety of general skills that I still apply day-to-day
professionally. He was a great teacher who pushed me to do better every chance
he got and he genuinely cared about my success.*"

-- Cory Berg  (paper published at ICLR)


"*Alex and I shared an office for over 2 years, during which time we worked on a
number of projects and published a paper.
Alex developed a clear strategy for the projects we worked on, outlining each
sub-task with accompanying milestones.
He provided helpful, constructive feedback any many projects in the broader
group we were a part of.
Many members of our broader group would seek advice from him on their projects
or career trajectories.*"

-- Ryan Zarcone, Ph.D.
